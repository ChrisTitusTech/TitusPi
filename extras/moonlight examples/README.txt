I left two scripts in this folder for moonlight examples

Apex Legends is using defaults with 720p w/ hdmi audio streaming 
Modern Warfare is using 1080p60 with local 3.5mm audio 

For firsttime setup you need to run from terminal
moonlight pair

then you can list your games with 
moonlight list

Then simply make the Sh files based on the ones I left in here.
